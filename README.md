# TypeORM, TypeGraphQL, Apollo boilerplate

This is a Node.js boilerplate with TypeORM, TypeGraphQL, and Apollo. Uses PostgreSQL, but feel free to swap that for any database.

I created this due to the unfortunate lack of GitHub repos with this tech stack. Hopefully this saves you time.

## Instructions

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and populate file with given environment variables (eg. database credentials)

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

GraphQL server will be running on http://localhost:4000/graphql
